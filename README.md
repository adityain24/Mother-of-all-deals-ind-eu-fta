### Key Conclusions

1. **Import taxes constitute a substantial portion of vehicle landed cost**  
   Under the current (No_FTA) regime, import duties and indirect taxes significantly inflate vehicle costs relative to their CIF values, resulting in high landed costs for imported passenger vehicles.

2. **The India–EU FTA leads to a clear reduction in import taxes and landed costs**  
   The With_FTA scenario consistently shows lower total import taxes and landed costs across all vehicles, confirming that reductions in Basic Customs Duty materially affect import economics.

3. **FTA savings scale with vehicle value in absolute terms**  
   Higher-priced and premium vehicles realize significantly larger absolute savings in INR, while lower-priced vehicles experience smaller monetary gains.

4. **Percentage savings are relatively uniform across vehicles and brands**  
   Despite differences in absolute savings, the percentage reduction in import taxes remains broadly similar, indicating that FTA benefits are driven by uniform tariff reductions rather than brand-specific advantages.

5. **Indirect taxes continue to dominate landed cost even after FTA implementation**  
   IGST and compensation cess remain unchanged under the FTA scenario and continue to form a large share of total landed cost, limiting the extent to which tariff liberalization alone can equalize imported and domestically priced vehicles.

### Policy Implications

- **Tariff liberalization alone may not make imports fully competitive**  
  While the FTA significantly reduces customs duties, the persistence of indirect taxes implies that imported vehicles are likely to retain a cost premium over domestic alternatives.

- **Premium vehicle segments benefit more in absolute monetary terms**  
  Policymakers should note that FTA benefits accrue disproportionately in INR terms to higher-value vehicles, which may influence market composition and import patterns.

- **Complementary tax reforms would amplify FTA impact**  
  Any policy objective aimed at significantly increasing import competitiveness would require a broader review of indirect tax structures in addition to customs duty reductions.

- **FTA impact is predictable and policy-driven**  
  The relatively stable percentage savings across vehicles suggests that FTA outcomes can be reliably estimated using scenario-based models, supporting informed policy and industry planning.

### Limitations and Scope for Further Work

- Import CIF values are estimated due to lack of publicly available invoice data.
- Dealer margins, logistics beyond the port, and registration costs are not included.
- Future work could extend the analysis to electric vehicles, alternative duty scenarios, or demand-side effects.
